        Welcome!
        
        I am a Ph.D. Economics candidate at the University of Oklahoma, Norman. I specialize in labor economics, the economics of education, and health economics. Before coming to Norman, I received a Master's in Applied Mathematics from the University of Central Oklahoma. 
        
        My current research centers on college costs, amenities, and the policies that shape student outcomes. Additionally, I examine the effects of policy on vaccine development and assess the impact of vaccination on the health outcomes of pregnant women and infants. My research has earned recognition through the Southern Economic Association Graduate Student Award, the OU Dodge Family College of Arts and Sciences Dissertation Research Fellowship, and the Chong Liew Summer Research Award.
        
        As a graduate instructor at the University of Oklahoma, I have independently taught introductory microeconomics, introductory macroeconomics, and business statistics. Additionally, while pursuing my master's in Applied Mathematics at the University of Central Oklahoma, I taught Intermediate Algebra.
