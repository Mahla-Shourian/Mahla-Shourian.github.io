        Welcome!
        
        I am a Ph.D. Economics candidate at the University of Oklahoma, Norman. I specialize in labor economics, the economics of education, and health economics. Before coming to Norman, I received a Master's in Applied Mathematics from the University of Central Oklahoma. 
        
        My current research centers on college costs, amenities, and relevant policies that shape student outcomes. In previous work, I delved into the study of policies impacting vaccine development. 
        
        My research has earned recognition through Southern Economic Association Graduate Student Award, the OU Dodge Family College of Arts and Sciences Dissertation Research Fellowship, and Chong Liew Summer Research Award.
