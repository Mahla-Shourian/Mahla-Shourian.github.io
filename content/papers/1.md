summary: "This study examines the impact of state funding on STEM and non-STEM degree completion at U.S. public four-year colleges. Using data from 2003 to 2019, I find that increased state appropriations significantly boost STEM degree completion, particularly for male students and at less selective institutions, while having minimal effect on non-STEM degrees. A 10% funding increase leads to a 3.4% rise in STEM degrees, mainly four years later, attributed to increased institutional spending and more STEM programs."

### Abstract

This study examines the differential impact of state appropriations on STEM and non-STEM degree completion at U.S. public four-year institutions. Using a panel dataset from 2003 to 2019 and a Bartik-style instrumental variables approach, I find that state funding disproportionately affects STEM degree completion, with little to no impact on Non-STEM
degrees. A 10% increase in state appropriations leads to a 3.4% increase in STEM degrees
conferred, primarily four years after the funding change. This effect is concentrated among male students, science STEM majors, and non-selective institutions. Increased state support leads to higher institutional spending, and more STEM programsâ€“factors that impact STEM degree completion more than non-STEM fields.
