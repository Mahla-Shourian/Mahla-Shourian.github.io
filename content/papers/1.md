summary: "This paper examines how recreational marijuana legalization (RML) affects first-time college enrollment in the US using a unique college-level dataset and various estimation methods such as difference-in-differences, event study, and synthetic controls. I find that RML increases enrollments by 4.6% to 9%, without compromising degree completion, and it boosts college competitiveness in RML states by offering a positive amenity, as evidenced by the rise in non-local enrollments relative to neighboring states. In addition, I find no evidence that RML affects college prices, quality, or local enrollment. This effect is stronger for non-selective public colleges in early-adopting RML states."

##### Abstract

This paper examines how recreational marijuana legalization (RML) affects first-time college enrollment in the US using a unique college-level dataset and various estimation methods such as difference-in-differences, event study, and synthetic controls. I find that RML increases enrollments by 4.6% to 9%, without compromising degree completion, and it boosts college competitiveness in RML states by offering a positive amenity, as evidenced by the rise in non-local enrollments relative to neighboring states. In addition, I find no evidence that RML affects college prices, quality, or local enrollment. This effect is stronger for non-selective public colleges in early-adopting RML states.
