##### Abstract

This paper examines how recreational marijuana legalization (RML) affects first-time college enrollment in the US using a unique college-level dataset and various estimation methods such as difference-in-differences and event study. I find that RML increases enrollments by approximately up to 9%, without compromising degree completion or graduation rate, and it boosts college competitiveness by offering a positive amenity, as evidenced by the rise in out-of-state enrollments relative to neighboring states. In addition, I find no evidence that RML affects college prices, quality, or in-state enrollment. This effect is stronger for non-selective public colleges in early-adopting RML states.

\textit{Note: } 
% the table displays the results of the TWFE difference-in-differences. 
The outcome variable in panel (a) refers to the logged number of all undergraduate degrees (associates and bachelors) conferred. In panels (b) and (c), the dependent variable is the graduation rate within the standard degree completion time (i.e., 4 years for bachelor) or or within 150\% of the normal time (i.e., 6 years for bachelor). The graduation rate refers the percentage of students in a cohort who completed their degrees within the specified times (100\% or 150\% of normal degree time). 
The policy is defined by law approval timing (see Figure \ref{fig:legal}) to allow the use of 6 leads. This is in contrast to prior exhibits which are based on the dispensary opening. A lead of "i" (ranging from 1 to 6) indicates that the ith lead of the outcome variable was used in the analysis. Colorado and Washington are the only treated states. Nevada, California, Oregon, and Massachusetts are dropped from this analysis due to the nonexistence of observations for leads of the outcome variable. The control group includes states that legalized marijuana for medical use (see figure \ref{fig:med_contol_groups_apdx} for more details). I report wild bootstrap p values following \cite{mackinnon2018wild} using 10,000 bootstrap iterations at state–year subcluster.
 Control variables and fixed effects are as described in Figure \ref{fig:main_law}.  Standard errors are clustered at the state level.
