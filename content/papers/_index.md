## Working Papers


### [When the Marriage Market Fails: How Changes in Relative Wages Shape Childbearing Decisions](/Shourian_2025_JMP_RelativeWages_Fertility.pdf)
**Co‑author:** Pallab Ghosh  
**Status:** Job Market Paper  
<details>
  <summary>Abstract [+]</summary>
  <p>Over the past several decades, U.S. fertility rates have steadily fallen while female-to-male relative wages have risen. This paper investigates whether these two trends are causally linked by examining how exogenous changes in women’s potential wages relative to men’s affect fertility decisions. I use a Bartik-style shift-share instrument to construct a measure of potential wages that captures long-term labor market opportunities while addressing endogeneity concerns inherent in observed earnings. The analysis focuses on women of childbearing age across U.S. states from 1980 to 2010, using Census and ACS data. The results show that increases in women’s relative potential wages lead to lower fertility, delayed age at first birth, and a higher likelihood of single motherhood. These patterns are consistent with several economic mechanisms, including shifts in marriage market dynamics, increased opportunity costs of motherhood, and changes in household bargaining power.

### [Children Who Witness: Early Life Exposure to Unilateral Divorce Laws and Intimate Partner Violence in Adulthood](/Shourian_Ghosh_ChildrenWhoWitness_UDL_IPV.pdf)
**Co‑author:** Pallab Ghosh  
<details>
  <summary>Abstract [+]</summary>
  <p>This study investigates the impact of early childhood exposure to unilateral divorce laws (UDL) as a framework for understanding childhood shocks and their influence on intimate partner violence (IPV) in adulthood. Using data from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) from 2000–2015, combined with state divorce regulations, we find that individuals aged 0–10 at the time of the reforms are 0.18 percentage points more likely to experience IPV in adulthood than older cohorts and those in states without UDL. Additionally, we examine how childhood exposure to UDL influences IPV victimization through its effects on education and employment outcomes.</p>

### [From Mother to Daughter: Policy Influences on Teenage Pregnancy]
**Co‑author:** Pallab Ghosh  
<details>
  <summary>Abstract [+]</summary>
  <p> This study examines the intergenerational effects of teenage pregnancy by investigating whether a mother’s teenage pregnancy influences her daughter’s likelihood of becoming a teenage mother. Using an instrumental variables approach, I employ policy shocks such as unilateral divorce laws as instruments. These policy changes are assumed to have affected the likelihood of a mother’s teenage pregnancy but have no direct influence on the daughter’s pregnancy except through the mother’s experience. I use restricted data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79) and the NLSY79 Young Adult and Children datasets, which allow me to track the daughters of NLSY79 mothers and their teenage pregnancy outcomes. Preliminary results using the publicly available NLSY data show that having a mother who experienced teenage pregnancy increases the probability of the daughter also becoming a teenage mother by approximately 13.5 percentage points.</p>
