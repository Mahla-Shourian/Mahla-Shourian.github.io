##### Abstract

I investigate the relationship between tuition and fees at US public four-year universities, driven by tuition caps and freeze policies. 
I find that a one-dollar increase in tuition results in a 45 to 62 cent reduction in fees. This substitution effect arises from state-imposed tuition caps and freezes, which limit tuition increases and lead some institutions to raise or introduce new fees instead. Employing an instrumental variable approach with tuition restriction policies, state legislative tuition freezes, and the Bartik instrument to address endogeneity, I reveal that while the fee share has a negative but insignificant effect on first-time college enrollment, it significantly impacts STEM major completions. A 10 percentage point increase in fee share leads to a 1.6 percent decrease in STEM major awards, highlighting the differential effects of fees on various academic programs.

**Notes:** Fees and tuition refer respectively to inflation adjusted as of 2019 of average undergraduate in-state fees and average undergraduate in-state tuition. The sample in (b) includes all institutions that have more tuition than fees.
