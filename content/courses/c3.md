description: "The objective of this course is to introduce students to basic microeconomic concepts and prepare them for future economic classes. By the end of this class, students should be able to understand microeconomic theory and its applications, prepare and understand basic equilibrium graphs, relate economic topics to real world situations, and 
explain economic principles." 
summary: "Microeconomics is a branch of economics that studies the behavior of individuals and businesses and how decisions are made based on the allocation of limited resources.  Microeconomics examines how these decisions and behaviors affect the supply and demand for goods and services, which determine the prices we pay."
