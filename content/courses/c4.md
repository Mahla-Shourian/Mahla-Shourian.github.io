description: "The objective of this course is to introduce students to basic Macroeconomics concepts and prepare them for future economic classes. By the end of this class, students should be able to (1) understand and explain basic macroeconomic concepts and basic elements of how the economy in the US is structured, (2)
apply their understanding of economics to current events, and (3) be able to distinguish between correct and incorrect economic logic
" 
summary: "Macroeconomics is a branch of economics that focuses on economic outcomes at the national level.  Questions like: “Why are some countries rich while others are poor?” and “Why do some countries experience rapid growth while others stagnate?” are complicated.  They are also best addressed after becoming familiar with a set of “tools” that facilitate a deep understanding of economic outcomes."
